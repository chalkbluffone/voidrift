A Balsurpian who breathes Xenon and keeps his delicate Balnarg tucked safely under three layers of ceremonial armor, Zoltan rules the battlefield with five thrashing tentacles while the sixth — the ingestion one — is perpetually wrapped around a canister of Synthetic Bload. Without it he goes docile, which he insists has never happened and anyone who says otherwise was vaporized at Treskelia. His greatest talent has always been turning foes into loyal minions — most of his conquests were won not by destroying armies but by convincing them to switch sides mid-battle.
